# Insurance-Claim-Project

**Insurance Claims**
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing for an insurance claims dataset. The dataset includes information about insurance claims, customer details, claim amounts, incident causes, and other relevant attributes.

**Dataset**
The dataset comprises two files:
claims_data.csv: Contains information about insurance claims, claim amounts, incident causes, and other claim-related details.
cust_data.csv: Contains customer information such as customer ID, age, gender, and state.

**Analysis and Insights**
The project aims to address various aspects of the insurance claims data through exploratory analysis and hypothesis testing, including:

**Data Preprocessing**
Combining the claims and customer data
Data type audit and corrections
Handling missing values and duplicate records
Deriving new features (e.g., age categories)

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
Calculating average claim amounts by customer segments
Analyzing claim amounts based on incident causes and dates
Identifying driver-related claims by state and age group
Visualizing claim amounts by gender, segment, and fraud status
Analyzing monthly trends in claim amounts

**Hypothesis Testing**
Similarity in claim amounts between males and females
Relationship between age category and segment
Significance of the current year's claim amounts compared to the previous fiscal average
Difference between age groups and insurance claims
Relationship between the total number of policy claims and the claimed amount

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scipy (for statistical tests)
